I'm calm, open-minded, and enjoy meaningful conversations with a good sense of humor. I'd appreciate someone who is encouraging and brings positive energy into life. I'm also very happy to support a partner who wants to continue her career if she's motivated or passionate about itâ€”I believe in supporting, not pushing. I'm interested in settling here in the UAE and I would appreciate it if my partner is also open to that possibility, In Sha Allah."
